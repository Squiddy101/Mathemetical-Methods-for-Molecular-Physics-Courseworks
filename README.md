# Mathematical Methods for Molecular Physics – Courseworks

This repository contains my completed **Coursework 1** and **Coursework 2** for the *Mathematical Methods for Molecular Physics* module at **Imperial College London**.

The work focuses on analytical techniques commonly used in molecular physics, including asymptotic expansions, Fourier analysis, scaling arguments, contour integration, and approximate solution methods for transcendental equations.
